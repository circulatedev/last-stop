# Last Stop 

Last Stop is the final place your prompt resides before sending your data to the black box. Last Stop is a DLP solution that allows you to mitigate data loss before prompts get sent to Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Bard (coming soon), and more. With each prompt, the data being monitored is checked for code, PII, sensitive organization data, and whatever else you'd like to define as a flag. Any flags in the data can result in blocking the message or can result in sanitizing the data prior to being submitted. Once the data has been validated and cleaned (if necessary), the request will be forwarded to the LLM.

__The best part? This is intended to run entirely on your own network!__

Make the most of these LLMs by leveraging them all in one application all while staying safe from DLP. After all, it is estimated that [11% of data that employees paste in ChatGPT contains sensitive data](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3691115/sharing-sensitive-business-data-with-chatgpt-could-be-risky.html).

# Deploying the Infrastructure

# This is under construction.

The infrastructure is intended to be a single command deployment. 
Use terraform workspaces, if you don't create a new workspace it will deploy to "default"

<br />

## Requirements
- [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html)
- Docker (Rancher Desktop or Docker Desktop)
- Terraform v1.4.2+ (recommend tfenv if using MacOS / Linux)
- Golang v1.20

<br />
